### PS (Side Note):
After a long try at understanding and analyzing the data using Univariate and Multi-Variate analysis and not getting anywhere; I decided to use many attributes in the model, so unfortunately couldn't get a good Accuracy.

Really think that the data distribution made it a lot difficult than it was supposed to be. My first time working with Churn Analysis and Real Data, so not much disappointed.
